Week Two Day 7 Lab on Fizz Buzz, Reversing a String, Capitalizing a Letter, Compressing a String of Characters, and Palindrome

1.	Fizz Buzz
    a.	Write a program that prints every number from 0 to 100 to the console
    b.	If a number is divisible by 3, print ‘fizz’ instead of the number
    c.	If a number is divisible by 5, print ‘buzz’ instead of the number
    d.	If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print ‘fizzbuzz’ instead of the number

2.	Reverse a string
    a.	Write code that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed
    b.  i.e. “Hello” will be returned as “olleH”

3.	Capitalize letter
    a.	Write code that takes a string as input and capitalize the first letter of each word. Words will be separated by only one space. i.e. “hello world” should be outputted as “Hello World”

4.	Compress a string of characters
    a.	For example, an input of "aaabbbbbccccaacccbbbaaabbbaaa" would compress to "3a5b4c2a3c3b3a3b3a"

5.	Palindrome
    a.	A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward i.e. madam
    b.	Write code that takes a user input and checks to see if it is a Palindrome and reports the result
